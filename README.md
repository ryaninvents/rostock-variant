# rostock-variant

Found some long-lost CAD files on my Google drive. Turns out they were
my original designs for my Rostock!

## Folder structure

* `/` -- root folder
 * `README.md` -- this file
 * `rostock-variant.SLDASM` -- start of my up-to-date CAD assembly,
   more closely matches my actual build
 * `/rostock` -- original files; I created them at WPI so they are
   tagged as "student only"
 * `/cabinet` -- updated cabinet files
